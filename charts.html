<h1>How does the Impossible Burger impact McDonalds' burger sales?</h1>
<h2>On the macro scale.....</h2>

<p>This is the whole dataset added together by date. We see that there is a slight dip in October of 2018.</p>

<p>If we zoom in on the X-axis, we see that there is a bigger dip from September to October in terms of sales of hamburgers, chicken fillets and fish fillets. We see that the sales slowly rise up, but is unable to get to the high point in july-august.

This implies that Burger King's Impossible Burger may have an impact on McDonald’s hamburger sales as a whole, and the impact is a clear decrease of McDonald’s burger sales in October as a whole.

<h2>on the micro-regional scale.......</h2>

<p>If we categorize the data into their different burger categories (hamburgers, chicken fillets, fish fillets), and separate them by region, we still see the slight dip in October 2018 as we have seen in the chart that plotted the whole data.

From the charts, we see that there really is a dip in hamburger sales in October of 2018 and the sales slowly recovered afterwards. The region that had the most impact is the Central region for all three different burgers. On the other hand, the north east region had the least impact. This could be because the northeast region has the lowest sales overall.
This also shows that perhaps these three items are favored by a lot of customers, so their trends look alike. There is no difference in sales in holiday seasons. Perhaps if McDonalds also released a new variation of a hamburger, we would see a big increase in sales in a particular month.

<h2>Macro - Geographical</h2>

<p>When separated into regions only and sales combined for all regions, there is still a dip in the October of 2018. All regions still have similar trends. </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>McDonald's sales data shows that there is a decrease in sales from September to October in both the macro/micro level, and it would be reasonable to assume that Burger King’s new Impossible Burger has impacted McDonalds’ burger sales in a negative way. Since the release of the Impossible Burger, the combined burger sales of McDonalds has decreased but then slowly rose back.

However, Without data from other sources, it would be difficult to know for certain whether or not the dip in sales in October 2018 is actually caused by the new release of the Impossible Burger.

<h2>Daily Sales Data</h2>

The daily sales data includes data in January 2016, and there seems to be no trend with the data.
